# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Using Python to understand U.S. bikeshare data by calculating statistics and building an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for a dataset to analyze.

## Code Quality

### Functionality of code
All code cells can be run without error.

### Choice of data types and structures
Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.

### Use of loops and conditional statements
Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly.

### Use of packages
Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks.

### Use of functions
Functions are used to reduce repetitive code.

### Use of good coding practices
Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.

## Script and Questions

### Solicit and handle raw user input
Raw input is solicited and handled correctly to guide the interactive question-answering experience; no errors are thrown when unexpected input is entered.

### Use descriptive statistics to answer questions about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user.
Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user in this manner: Script should prompt the user if they want to see 5 lines of raw data, display that data if the answer is 'yes', and continue these prompts and displays until the user says 'no'.
